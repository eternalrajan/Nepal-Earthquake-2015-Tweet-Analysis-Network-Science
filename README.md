# Nepal-Earthquake-2015-Tweet-Analysis-Network-Science
The Project involves the use of centrality measures (Degree, Eigen Vector, Katz, Closeness, Betweenness Centralities) to extract the most important, and overlapping tweets from the given Nepal earthquake 2015 tweet data based on time and text.  
(Aug 2019 - Sep 2019)

Centrality measures are used for determining the importance of a node in the given network. Several centrality measures (Degree, Eigen Vector, Katz, Closeness, Betweenness Centralities) are used to find the important characteristics for different purposes like graph search, social network influence, disease spread networks. The aim of the project is to find the important, and overlapping tweets from the tweet data of Nepal Earthquake 2015 tragedy.

* Language: Python 3.7.4
